= Hub XMLRPC API


The Hub XMLRPC API helps to operate SUSE Manager or Uyuni infrastructures with one Server, called a Hub, managing several Servers.
Servers are registered and can be managed from the Hub just like normal SUSE Manager or Uyuni clients. In addition to that, the Hub XMLRPC API provides a more convenient way to access all Servers' XMLRPC APIs from one only endpoint in the Hub.

= Manual mode


In this example, relay mode is used, this is a convenient method where it is assumed that each server has an admin user with the same credentials as one of Hub's user but user still needs to call `attachToServers` method.
Here in this example, following is happening

[square]
* User provide credentials for the hub to the login method, a `sessionkey` for the hub is returned
* Using the sessionkey from the previous step, `serverIds` for the servers attached to the hub are requested
* User calls the hub method `attachToServers`. Hub will use the same credentials used in step-1 to authenticate the specified servers.
* `multicast` call is being performed on the specific servers where `serverId` is used to identify the specific sever. Behind the scenes, `system.list_system method` of each {productname} server's xmlrpc api method will be called to get the list of the clients registed with each {productname} server
* Hub will take care of collecting these results and return in form of a `map`. This map has two entries, entry with `Successfull`  key, has list of responses where call was successful while with `Failed` key  has the failed ones.

[NOTE]
====
If user wish to get information from only one {productname} server, then Hub also provided a convenient `unicast` namespace. In this case, result would not be returned as map rather exactly as the result are expectd as if user directly call that {productname} server's api.
====

* User logs out

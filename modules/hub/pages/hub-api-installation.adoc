= Hub XMRPC API Installation

Install the `hub-xmlrpc-api` package, which is available from {productname} repositories, either on the Hub itself or on a host that has access to all Servers' XMLRPC APIs.
All the configuration that is needed by Hub XMLRPC API should be available in the file ``/etc/hub/hub-xmlrpc-api-config.json`. One needs to point `manager_api_url` to the Hub's FQDN if necessary.

In addition to that , there are 2 more timeout parameters (`connect_timeout` & `read_write_timeout`) are defined in this configuration file. Values for these parameters are defined in seconds.
A restart of service is needed to reflect any changes in these values.
